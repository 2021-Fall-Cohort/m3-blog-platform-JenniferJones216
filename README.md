# Blog Platform
- A full-stack, server-side-rendered, web application.
- Front-end portion using HTML and CSS. 
- Back-end portion using ASP.Net Core, Entity Framework and a SQL database.

## The Scenario
We've been hired by NobodyCares Inc. to build a Proof of Concept (PoC) application for a company looking to make the next new hot blogging platform! This being a PoC app, we don't (yet) have to worry about all of the security and user management concerns that we would have in a fully functional application. All our client wants from us are the beginnings of the actual User eXperience (UX). Our client also wants an in depth and COMPLETE look at our applications User Interface (UI), so let's make it look good.

## Controllers
We need to direct traffic efficiently. All of our entities should be managed by their own Controller. For example, all interaction with Content should be isolated to one Controller. You may have to ACCESS other entities in your Controllers. But the main entities that Controller is meant to direct should be well organized.

## Views
We need Views to display all of our Content. But we should also be able to view our Content based on the other identifying components we have (Categories). We should have Index Views that display the collections of all entities as well as Details Views to display an individual instance of an entity. We should have navigation very clearly presented on all pages so that the user is able to navigate through our application.

Our users should be able to add new Content to the Content Index page. Title, Body, and Author data will be entered into a text box by the user, but Category should be selected from a drop down list (which can be hard coded in your html view) and Publish Date should be automatically generated by the system.

Alternatively, you can allow users to add new Content from the Category Details page. Title, Body, and Author data will be entered into a text box by the user. You can use the CreateById action to capture the appropriate CategoryId, eliminating the need for a Category drop down list.

In addition, give users the ability to update or delete an existing Content instance.

Make sure all collections are organized with proper containing elements (i.e. ol or ul for list items).
